•	HTML and JavaScript: HTML is the standard markup language for building web pages, and JavaScript is a widely-used programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web applications. HTML was used to create the structure and layout of the website, while JavaScript was used for implementing dynamic functionalities such as data fetching, form validation, and event handling.

•	ReactJS: ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was used extensively in this project for creating reusable UI components, managing state and props, handling user interactions, and rendering dynamic content. ReactJS features such as useState, useEffect, useSelector, and useDispatch were utilized to manage state, handle side effects, and dispatch actions for state updates.

•	Redux: Redux is a state management library that complements ReactJS and was used in this project for managing global state. Redux provides a centralized store for managing application state, making it easier to share data and handle complex state management scenarios. Redux was used to handle state related to user authentication, product data, shopping cart, and orders.

•	React Router: React Router is a popular routing library for ReactJS that allows for client-side routing and navigation in a single-page application. It was used in this project for handling routing and navigation between different pages of the website. BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and Link components were utilized to define routes, render components based on the URL, and create links for navigation.

Bootstrap's grid system, typography, and UI components were utilized to create a visually appealing and responsive design for the website.

•	Skeleton: Skeleton is a lightweight CSS framework that provides a minimal set of CSS styles for building simple and responsive web applications. It was used in this project for creating loading skeletons or placeholders for content that is being fetched asynchronously. Skeleton components were utilized to provide a better user experience by showing loading indicators while data is being fetched.

•	Marquee: Marquee is a JavaScript library that provides a scrolling effect for text or other content. It was used in this project for creating scrolling banners and promotional messages on the website. Marquee was utilized to add dynamic and eye-catching elements to the website's design, enhancing its visual appeal.
